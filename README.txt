This project was created and programmed by Dylan Raub.
Special thanks goes to Richard Warden, whom without I wouldn't have even tried Pyweek,
and who's input and ideas have always been of significant importance to me.

Most of the music was remixed versions of Megaman 3 songs, excluding the song at the end of the game, which Dylan Raub
composed himself. Credit for the original Megaman 3 songs goes to Yasuaki Fujita. The death music is from The Legend of
Zelda - credit for that theme goes to Koji Kondo.

This project was done as part of October PyWeek #19.

 ===== RUNNING THE GAME =====

To run the source-code for most operating system (Windows, Linux, Mac OS), first make sure the below dependencies
have been met. After that, simply double-click the file named "NeverEndingDungeon.py", or run the file through console
if your root "python.exe" file is not from the python27 folder.

 ===== DEPENDENCIES/REQUIREMENTS =====

This project can run on Windows XP (or higher).

This project hasn't been tested yet on other operating systems,
but it should run on most Linux distributions and some of the most modern Mac OS's.

To run the source-code on any OS, you'll need:

 - python 2.7.x (I'd recommend 2.7.8, since it's the most stable.)
   https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/

 - pygame 1.9.2a0 (For Windows users. Install the one that matches the version of your python install - whether it was 32 bit or 64 bit is important!)

   OR

   The most recent, official version of pygame for your OS.
